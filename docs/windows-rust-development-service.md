# Windows Rust development service

The Phase 2 host serves the synthetic status replay over a local Windows named pipe. The existing WinUI `ServiceClient` can connect by name through its existing constructor. The tool is a standalone Cargo workspace outside the product's Rust dependency graph and publish inputs. The installed C# service remains the hardware owner.

## Run the isolated test

Use the pinned Rust toolchain, Windows MSVC tools and the repository's .NET SDK. From the repository root in PowerShell:

```powershell
Push-Location rust
try {
    $manifest = '../tools/openblade-windows-host/Cargo.toml'
    cargo test --locked --manifest-path $manifest
    cargo build --locked --manifest-path $manifest
} finally {
    Pop-Location
}
$env:OPENBLADE_RUST_DEV_HOST_EXE = (Resolve-Path 'tools/openblade-windows-host/target/debug/openblade-windows-host.exe').Path
dotnet restore src/OpenBlade.Tray/OpenBlade.Tray.csproj
dotnet test tests/OpenBlade.Tray.Tests/OpenBlade.Tray.Tests.csproj --filter FullyQualifiedName~RustReadOnlyHostTests
Remove-Item Env:OPENBLADE_RUST_DEV_HOST_EXE
```

The integration tests launch their own foreground processes and assign fresh pipe IDs. To run the host interactively, invoke the executable with `foreground <id>` or `foreground-background <id>` and a 32-character lowercase hexadecimal ID. Use a fresh ID generated with `[Guid]::NewGuid().ToString('N')`. It prints `READY` after successfully claiming `OpenBlade.Rust.ReadOnly.Dev.<id>`. Send a newline or close its input to stop. The latter mode exercises inactive-session projection for an admitted same-logon client.

## Compatibility boundary

- Each connection accepts one v79 `getStatus` or `subscribeStatus` request, or one v51 `getStatus` request. The v79 response and event use the [managed replay fixtures](windows-backend-replay.md). The subscription first sends the preceding synthetic revision and then one exact newer fixture event. v51 returns only the CLI fixture's approved fields and closes. Request IDs correlate replies. Every read uses in-memory fixtures and has no activation or state changes.
- Framing uses a signed 32-bit little-endian byte count and caps bodies at 64 KiB. There is a two-second first-frame deadline and a two-second deadline per write. Invalid lengths, malformed envelopes, invalid identity and unsupported versions close the connection. Other operations receive a correlated refusal before any dispatch. The host allows eight concurrent handlers and four concurrent subscriptions, with one additional listening instance and a private first-instance claim. The host promptly closes connections above capacity and retries a temporarily busy listener replacement for up to two seconds.
- Windows claims the first instance exclusively and rejects remote connections. The explicit DACL restricts access to the host account. After reading the request bytes, the host resolves the pipe token and requires the same SID, logon authentication ID and Windows session. This is a same-logon development trust boundary. The ordinary duplex C# client asks for generic write, which also gives its SID permission to create pipe instances. It does not establish server trust against another process in that logon. Both projections exercise synthetic authorization inputs behind the native identity check. They do not replicate active-session selection or LocalSystem access policy.
- Rust tests cover the wire fixtures and native endpoint checks, including first-instance contention, listener saturation and recovery, an anonymous client, and start/stop ordering through the shared lifecycle with an injected SCM reporter and stop signal. The .NET tests exercise the real tray client through the foreground endpoint, including initial status, event, cancellation and reconnect. They supplement that path with managed codec and v51 raw frames. The Windows job in the Rust workflow runs both sets on stacked PRs.

## Native SCM gate

The executable links the native dispatcher and registers the stop/shutdown handler from its `--scm` entry point. That mode is reserved for an externally provisioned development service named `OpenBladeRustReadOnlyDev` and the fixed pipe `OpenBlade.Rust.ReadOnly.Dev.scm`. It uses the same account/logon admission, so a regular desktop client should be denied across the service logon boundary. The development executable does not provision a service.

The Rust workflow runs the native lifecycle smoke only on GitHub-hosted Windows VMs for same-repository pull requests. It checks a clean namespace, stages a hash-verified copy of the tested binary, and registers the demand-start service as LocalService. It verifies that a pre-existing pipe causes startup to fail, then observes RUNNING with an available listener and STOPPED with the pipe retired on two start/stop cycles. The runner's different-account pipe open must be denied. Cleanup stops and deletes the service and removes the staged binary.

The foreground interoperability suite still owns admitted-client and in-flight connection coverage. The hosted service smoke uses a separate account and does not test an admitted service-logon subscriber during SCM STOP or establish product multi-user policy. A test requiring those conditions needs a separately authorized disposable Windows VM.
